For those who need to know which mod writes stuff to the chat!

Shows the source of messages in the chat. Clientside, toggleable via config
Example:

Before:
"Your world has been blessed with Cobalt!"
"Player got 10 tier 1 Reversivity coins and now has 70 in total."

After:
"Your world has been blessed with Cobalt!"
"[AlchemistNPC] Player got 10 tier 1 Reversivity coins and now has 70 in total."


Notes:
- Some stuff like ore spawn announcements in multiplayer will show no mod associated because those messages are serversided
- Death messages won't have an associated mod
- "[Terraria]" prefix for vanilla messages is by default disabled
- Toggle "Display Name" and "Internal Name" of a mod via config
