[b]Notes:[/b]
- Some stuff like ore spawn announcements in multiplayer will show no mod associated because those messages are serversided
- Death messages won't have an associated mod
- "[Terraria]" prefix for vanilla messages is by default disabled
- Toggle "Display Name" and "Internal Name" of a mod via config
