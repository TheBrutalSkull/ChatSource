For those who need to know which mod writes stuff to the chat!

#### Common situation:

![Situation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/direwolf420/ChatSource/1.4/situation.png)

Shows the source of messages in the chat. Clientside, toggleable via config.

#### Examples:

**Before:**

![Fixed](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/direwolf420/ChatSource/1.4/fixed.png)

```
"Your world has been blessed with Cobalt!"
"Player got 10 tier 1 Reversivity coins and now has 70 in total."
```

**After:**

```
"Your world has been blessed with Cobalt!"
"[AlchemistNPC] Player got 10 tier 1 Reversivity coins and now has 70 in total."
```

**Notes:**
* Some stuff like ore spawn announcements in multiplayer will show no mod associated because those messages are serversided
* Death messages won't have an associated mod
* "[Terraria]" prefix for vanilla messages is by default disabled
* Toggle "Display Name" and "Internal Name" of a mod via config
